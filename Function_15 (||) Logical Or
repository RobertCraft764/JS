// The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

// If we want to find a value between 2( here 10 and 20 inclusive) numbers the && operator is a must or else all conditions used to test values above 20 and below 10 wont satisfy .
// But if we use && operator we wont be using the || operator which must be used at least once in this exercise.
